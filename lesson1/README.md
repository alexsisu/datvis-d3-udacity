The Visualization is important. Picture means thousand word is no joke.

Data Visualization
Scott Murray, mentioned that data visualization is about how to turn
mapping from value to visuals
mapping, value to visuals
Data VIsualization, structured information, table,. Taking organized
data to graph that visualy interesting.

While Cole Nussbaumer, Founder of storrytellingwithdata.com,also say similar thing. It's about how we turn number into pictures and stories.
Mainly, the visualization is divided into two categories:

* exploratory : the visualization is for us only. Finding the data in
  gem 
* explanatory :  communicate with the people, 

For teaching the visualization, Cole divide 
1. What are the audience, the context
2. Choosing type of visuals. Audience need them in easy way.
3. Eliminating not worth adding the data.
4. Ordering place,(color,size) so priortize more
5. Story, narratively
