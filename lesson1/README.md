There is an experience that I have with data visualization. I once audit
data from OpenStreetMap, the open source powered for map navigation. I
downloaded whole map of jakarta in JOSM file, and began to audit the
data (in XML format). After that I uploaded the cleaned data to the
OpenStreetMap website. Turns out the data that I've cleaned change the
way it should work. Someone, from OpenStreetMap Indonesia told me that
I'm not audit the file correctly, and show me the visualization of the
map that I have audit. I make mistakes. So Visualization is important to
get insight of the data. But it also important to visualize again after
you do something with it.

The Visualization is important. Picture means thousands word is no
joke.Data Visualization is about how we turned raw data, number in table,
row, or columns, to visuals. It's about how we use visualization
presented with right kind of plot or colors.It takes our creativity to
makes visualization that is interesting, simpler, but also
understandable.

Cole Nussbaumer, Founder of storrytellingwithdata.com, said that Data
Visualization is about how we turned number into picture and stories.
Makes people that read our visualization have an 'AHA' moment.

To put it simpler, Data Visualization has been split into two main
category, Exploratory and Explanatory. In Exploratory, we want to know
what is the data, how we defined it. Use the visualization to find the
gem from all the rock. Have some unbiased presentation so reader would
understand. After you get the analysis, you share your insights in the
Explanatory.

Explanatory itself has been divided into five steps.

1. Target your audience. What kind of audience that should have
   listened? If you have public audience, you want to make a
visualization that caught general attention. If you present it to other
scientists, you want to make more scientific approach. Or maybe from
different age, or different category.
2. After understand your audience, you want to make appropriate visuals.
   Choose what kind of plot, what kind of graph that optimal to
communicate your findings to your targeted audience. Use colors and
annotation.
3. Then eliminate the content that not worth adding. Decrease difficult
   grammar, or biased statement that makes your audience lost their
attention.
4. Then move the position of your plot accordingly. When they enter your
   page, what are the first visualization do they see, and what's next
in order. This is important as you want to tell a story.
5. Make it a narrative story. This is the best kind of story if you want
   to communicate your finding.

It really is how we ask interesting quesions about the data. Even if the
data simple, only containing two data points, it still can substract
effective information.
Get intersting thing to extract slope. Plot two data points.
